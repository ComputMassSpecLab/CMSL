## A New Start at the University of Amsterdam (UvA)
The Computational Mass Spectrometry Lab (CMSL) will start its activities at the University of Amsterdam within the *Van't Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences (HIMS)* on May 1st 2020. The team will focus on application of advanced statistics, signal processing, and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) for better understanding of complex systems ([more details](https://hims.uva.nl/content/news/2020/04/analytical-scientist-saer-samanipour-appointed-as-assistant-professor.html?origin=Y0HK108uT1aEZesHxZHHvg&cb)).

The CMSL will be led be Dr. Samanipour, who has been appointed as an Assistant Professor in Analytical Chemistry. One of the objectives of his team will be to bridge the gap between the fundamental and applied research, employing big data approaches. More details are available in [research](https://computmassspeclab.github.io/website/research/) and in [publications](https://computmassspeclab.github.io/website/publication/).
