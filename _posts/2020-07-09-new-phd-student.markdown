## The CMS-L will have a new Member

Denice van Herwerden will join CMS-L as a PhD candidate from 1st of August 2020. She will use her knowledge in Chemometrics and method optimization to build a toolbox for HRMS data processing.

*Bio*:
After finishing high school, I was interested in forensics sciences and started a bachelor in chemistry. During my bachelor projects, I developed an interest in analytical chemistry and programming, resulting in me following an analytical chemistry master. In general, all my research projects have been close to the fundamental theories of the analysis methods of interest. Additionally, I did a minor project on investigating the influence of packing particle size in hydrodynamic chromatography on the elution profile with computational fluid dynamics. As for my final project, I was able to use my programming skills for the development of algorithms for both the automated optimization of heart-cut two-dimensional liquid chromatography and diode UV-Vis multiple wavelength peak tracking. After this project, I was certain that I wanted to pursue a career in the field of data analysis
