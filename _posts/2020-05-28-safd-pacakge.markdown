## SAFD.jl is now available in Bitbucket Repo

A package written in [julia language ](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.0/) for performing feature detection of HRMS data is now available in our [Bitbucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/SSamanipour/safd.jl/src/master/). The details of the algorithm itself can be found in our recently published [article](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b02422). Detailed instructions on how to install and use it are provided in the readme document. Please let us know if you have difficulties installing or using it. For *python* and *R* users please take a look at [pyjulia](https://github.com/JuliaPy/pyjulia) and [JuliaCall](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/JuliaCall/index.html).
